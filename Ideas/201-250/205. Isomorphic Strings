Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of 
characters. No two characters may map to the same character but a character may map to itself.

For example,
Given "egg", "add", return true.

Given "foo", "bar", return false.

Given "paper", "title", return true.

Note:
You may assume both s and t have the same length.

Each character can only be mapped to one character, therefore, we can use two arrays as hashmap.

The code is as following:
class Solution {
    public boolean isIsomorphic(String s, String t) {
        int[] ss=new int[128];
        int[] tt=new int[128];
        int count=1;
        for(int i=0; i<s.length(); i++){
            char sss=s.charAt(i), ttt=t.charAt(i);            
            if(ss[sss]!=tt[ttt]) return false;
            ss[sss]=count;
            tt[ttt]=count;
            count++;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
