Given a string containing just the characters '(' and ')', find the length of the longest valid (well-formed) parentheses substring.

Example 1:

Input: "(()"
Output: 2
Explanation: The longest valid parentheses substring is "()"
Example 2:

Input: ")()())"
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest valid parentheses substring is "()()"

The idea is to use two Stack, one for chars that are not able to form parentheses, and the other is for indices of these chars.
After that, we simply count the difference between these indices and get the largest diff, that would be the answer.
