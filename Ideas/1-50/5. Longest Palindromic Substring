Given a string s, find the longest palindromic substring in s. You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.

Example:

Input: "babad"

Output: "bab"

Note: "aba" is also a valid answer.
Example:

Input: "cbbd"

Output: "bb"

This problem can be solved by using dynamic programming, the structure of
optimal solution is that, for substring(i,j) with length>=3, if it is
palindrome, then substring(i+1, j-1) should also be palindrome. Thus we can
solve it using bottom-up fashion.
