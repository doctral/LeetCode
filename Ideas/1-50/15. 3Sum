Given an array S of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in S such that a + b 
+ c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

Note: The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

For example, given array S = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4],

A solution set is:
[
  [-1, 0, 1],
  [-1, -1, 2]
]

This problem can be degraded to two-sum problem. To handle duplicate easily, we 
sort the array at first. Then from index=0 to index=nums.length-3, we set a 
number as the first element. For the rest part of array, we just need to find 
two numbers sum to the target number. Since it's sorted, this can be done in O(
N). Therefore, the total time complexity is O(n^2).
