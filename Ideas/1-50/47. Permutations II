Given a collection of numbers that might contain duplicates, return all possible unique permutations.

Example:

Input: [1,1,2]
Output:
[
  [1,1,2],
  [1,2,1],
  [2,1,1]
]

The key point in this problem is to remove duplicates. Then we can use the same idea in 46. Permutations.
i. used[i] == true --> current element has been used, therefore, we need to continue.
ii. i>0 && nums[i]==nums[i-1] && !used[i-1] --> when a number has the same value with its previous, we can use this number only if his previous is used
