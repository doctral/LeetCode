Find the next smaller number or next greater number using the same digits.

##########################################################################
Find the next smaller number (From the right side, we need to swap a smaller 
digit with a bigger digit in its leftside): (i.e: 5812349)
Therefore, there are 4 steps:
1. From the rightmost side, find the first digit (id1) that is greater than its 
previous (id1+1) digit (that is 8 with index id1);
2. From the rightmost side, find the first digit that is smaller than digit with 
index id1. That is 4.
3. Swap 8 and 4.
4. From id1+1 to last digit, we swap each pair of digits from two sides. Done!

Find the next greater number is similar. (From the right side, we need to swap a 
smaller digit with a bigger digit in its leftside):
Again, 4 steps: (i.e:4202320)
1: from the rightmost side, find the first digit that is smaller than its 
previous digit. (that is 2 with index 3)
2. From the rightmost side, find the first digit that is greater than that digit.
3&4. The same as above.
