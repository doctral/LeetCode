Given an unsorted integer array, find the first missing positive integer.

For example,
Given [1,2,0] return 3,
and [3,4,-1,1] return 2.

Your algorithm should run in O(n) time and uses constant space.

From the left side, if there is no missing positive integer, then the array should 
be a collection of 1,2,3,4,5,...,n. 
Therefore, we don't need to take care of numbers <1 or >n.
And we simply need to move each num with 1<= num <= n to its right position, and then check the 
array again to find the first missing positive integer. 

To check if a number with 1<= num <=n is in its right position, its correct index=num-1, and if 
its position has the right number, then nums[num-1]==num.
