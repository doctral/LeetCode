Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. Do this without extra space.

#############################################################################
Edge case: All negative number would not be palindrome.
           number between 0 and 9 (inclusive) is palindrome.

Step 1: we need to find the MST digit by doing:
int high=1;
while(num/high>=10){
	high*=10;
}
Step 2: while num>0, keep comparing the MSD(num/high) with LSD(num%10);
        update num=(num%high)/10; // remove both MSD and LSD
        update high=high/100; (each time eliminate two digits)
