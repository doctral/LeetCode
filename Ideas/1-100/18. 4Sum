Given an array S of n integers, are there elements a, b, c, and d in S such that 
a + b + c + d = target? Find all unique quadruplets in the array which gives the 
sum of target.

Note: The solution set must not contain duplicate quadruplets.

For example, given array S = [1, 0, -1, 0, -2, 2], and target = 0.

A solution set is:
[
  [-1,  0, 0, 1],
  [-2, -1, 1, 2],
  [-2,  0, 0, 2]
]

The basic idea is similar to 3SUM problem. 
To improve the time complexity, we can set a series of checking point to speed
the algorithm.
