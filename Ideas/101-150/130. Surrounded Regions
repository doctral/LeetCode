Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O' (the letter O), capture all regions surrounded by 'X'.

A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.

For example,
X X X X
X O O X
X X O X
X O X X
After running your function, the board should be:

X X X X
X X X X
X X X X
X O X X

This problem can be solved by using DFS or BFS.
However, when the matrix is really large, using DFS approach may easily cause stackoverflow error. 
Using BFS approach with a queue or stack would be safer way.
