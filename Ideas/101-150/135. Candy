There are N children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

Each child must have at least one candy.
Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
What is the minimum candies you must give?

We can solve this problem in three steps:
1. Create a new array with initialization 1;
2. from left to right, if ratings[i]>ratings[i-1], then candies[i]=candies[i-1]+1.
   Now from left to right, the requirement has been satisfied.
3. From right to left, if ratings[i-1]>ratings[i], we then simply set candies[i-1]=max(candies[i-1], 
candies[i]+1);// candies[i-1] is updated in step 2 from left to right, now we need to make sure it 
has the largest value to satisfy both sides.
