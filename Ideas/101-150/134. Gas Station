There are N gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at station i is gas[i].

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from station i to its 
next station (i+1). You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once, otherwise return -1.

Note:
The solution is guaranteed to be unique.

There are two key points we must understand before we can have an efficient idea.
1) if the total left for all stations is <0, then there is no solution.
2) from any point i, if point k is the first station it can not reach, then all points from i to k 
can not be the starting point. (think about why?)
