Implement atoi to convert a string to an integer.
Hint: Carefully consider all possible input cases. If you want a challenge, 
please do not see below and ask yourself what are the possible input cases.

Notes: It is intended for this problem to be specified vaguely (ie, no given 
input specs). You are responsible to gather all the input requirements up front.

There are many edge cases that we need to be careful.
1) We should trim the input string at first. After that, if the string is empty, 
then return 0;
2) We check the character in the trimed string, if it's number or +/-, then we can handle this case, otherwise, this string is not a number and we just return 0;
3) Now we can go through the string. If we find that the current character is 
not a digit, then stop here and return the previous value; Otherwise, keep 
update the value by doing num=num*10+currDigit.
Take care of overfitting problem.
