Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an m x n matrix. This matrix has the following properties:

Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.
For example,

Consider the following matrix:

[
  [1,   3,  5,  7],
  [10, 11, 16, 20],
  [23, 30, 34, 50]
]
Given target = 3, return true.

Given a matrix with m*n, its indices range from 0 to m*n-1; Be very careful when convert the index to 
matrix position. 
row=index/matrix[0].length, col=index%matrix[0].length. 
Then according to this, use binary search to solve this problem.
