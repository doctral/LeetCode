You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Note: Given n will be a positive integer.

Example 1:

Input: 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
Example 2:

Input: 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step

This problem can be solved using dynamic programming.
Assume now we are at point n with result f(n), there are two ways to go there, one is one step from (n-1) stair, and the other is
 two steps from (n-2) stair. Therefore, f(n)=f(n-1)+f(n-2).
