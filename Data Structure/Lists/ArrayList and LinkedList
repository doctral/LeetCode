ArrayList:
ArrayList is implemented using an array (E[] objects) with a fixed size. When the array is full, create a new array twice as large as the current one, copy the element from the current array to the new array.
The add(int index, E e) and remove(int index) methods in ArrayList is not efficient.

LinkedList:
A Linked List is implemented using a linked structure.
If the node is the last in the list, its pointer data field 'next' contains the value null. This property can be used to detect the last 
node.
