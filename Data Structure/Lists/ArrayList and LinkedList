ArrayList:
ArrayList is implemented using an array (E[] objects) with a fixed size. When the array is full, create a new array twice as large as the
current one, copy the element from the current array to the new array.
The add(int index, E e) and remove(int index) methods in ArrayList is not efficient.
The amortized insertion runtime is O(1), since the total number of copies to insert N elements is roughly 1+2+...+N/8+N/4+N/2, which is just less than N. Therefore, inserting N elements takes about O(N) work total, and each insertion is O(1) on average. 

LinkedList:
A Linked List is implemented using a linked structure.
If the node is the last in the list, its pointer data field 'next' contains the value null. This property can be used to detect the last
node.

Vector:
Vector is the same as the array list, except that Vector contains synchronized methods for accessing and modifying the vector.
