Stack:
Since the insertion and deletion operations on a stack are made only at the end of the stack, it is more efficient to implement a stack
with an ARRAY LIST than a linked list. 
A stack can be used to implement a recursive algorithm iteratively. 

Queue:
Since the deletions are made at the beginning of the list, it is more efficient to implement a queue using a linked list than a array list. 
Queues are often used in BFS or in implementing a cache.
