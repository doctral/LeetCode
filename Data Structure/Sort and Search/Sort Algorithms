Selection Sort:
    Algorithm: find the smallest number in the array and swap it with the first num in the array.
               Repeat this step until only a number remains.
               
Insertion Sort:
    Algorithm: repeatedly inserting a new element into a sorted sublist until the whole array is sorted.

Bubble Sort:
    Algorithm: on each pass, sucessive neighboring pairs are compared. If a pair is in decreasing order, its values are swapped. 

Merge Sort:
    Algorithm: divides the array into two halves and applies a merge sort on each half recursively. After the two halves are sorted,
    then merge them.
