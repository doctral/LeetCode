Key points: 
1. The backtracking algorithm traverses the search tree recursively, from the root down, in depth-first order. At each node c, the algorithm checks whether c can be completed to a valid solution. If it cannot, the whole sub-tree rooted at c is skipped. Otherwise, the algorithm checks whether c itself is a valid solution, and if so reports to it to the user, and then recursively enumerates all sub-trees of c. 
2. Six parameters: root(p), reject(p,c), accept(p,c), first(p,c), next(p,c), output(p,c)

procedure bt(c)
  if reject(P,c) then return
  if accept(P,c) then output(P,c)
  s ← first(P,c)
  while s ≠ Λ do
    bt(s)
    s ← next(P,s)
